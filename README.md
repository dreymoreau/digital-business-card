# Digital Business Card

What I learned while working on and completing this project:
- how to start and stop a server
- how certain dependencies are needed to run the server, so when removing node_modules from the root folder, the terminal doesn't recognize react-scripts
- the index.html file needs to stay in the public folder when running the server
- when using photos for React components, they must be imported into the direct file that it is being used in
- writing className="" instead of class="" in javascript files
